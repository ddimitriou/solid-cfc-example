## SOLID Principles Examples in Coldfusion

### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. [Example](./1-single-responsibility-principle.cfc)

### Open Closed Principle
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. [Example](./2-open-closed-principle.cfc)

### Liskov Substitution Principle
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. [Example](./3-liskov-substitution-principle.cfc)

### Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. [Example](./4-interface-segregation-principle.cfc)

### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions. [Example](./5-dependency-inversion-principle.cff)
